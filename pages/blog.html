          <h2>My Experience with Marine Biology</h2>
          <p>As a biology major in college, I took a course on marine biology and it completely changed my perspective on the field. The class was taught by a professor who had spent years studying coral reefs and the organisms that inhabit them. She was so passionate about her work and it showed in the way she taught the class.</p>
          <p>One of the highlights of the course was a field trip we took to a nearby beach to study the tidal pools. We were able to see firsthand the incredible diversity of life that exists in these small ecosystems. It was amazing to see how the organisms had adapted to survive in such a harsh environment.</p>
          <p>After that class, I knew I wanted to pursue a career in marine biology. I went on to complete a graduate degree in the field and have since worked on a number of research projects focused on understanding the impacts of climate change on coral reefs. It's been incredibly fulfilling work and I'm grateful to have had that initial experience in college that set me on this path.</p>
